title: Serialization & Serialization Boundaries

# `$` Boundaries

## Rules

- Only serializable data can cross a `$` boundery.

## Serialization Boundery

A serialization boundery occures whenever you cross a lexical scope of a function that is converted into lazy loadable form. It is always denoted by `$(...)` (or `____$(...)`) See example:

```tsx
import {component$} from "@builder.io/qwik";

export const topLevel = Promise.resolve('nonserializable data');

export const Greeter = component$(() => {
  // BEGIN component serialization boundery

  // Referring to top level symbols that are exported is always allowed.
  console.log(topLevel); // OK

  const captureSerializable = 'serializable data';
  const captureNonSerializable = Promise.resolve('nonserializable data');
  return (
    <button onClick$={() => {
      // BEGIN onClick serialization boundery

      // Referring to top level symbols that are exported is always allowed.
      // Even if the value is non-serializable.
      console.log(topLevel); // OK

      // Capturing a non-toplevel variable is allowed only if:
      // - declaed as `const`
      // - is serializable (runtime error)
      console.log(captureSerializable); // OK

      // Reffering to captureNonSerializable will pass static analysis but
      // will fail at runtime because Qwik does not know how to serilize it.
      console.log(captureNonSerializable); // RUNTIME ERROR

      // END onClick serialization boundery
    }}>
      click
    </button>
  );
  // BEGIN component serialization boundery
});

```
