# Qwikloader

Qwik is designed for fine-grained lazy loading of your application. To achieve lazy-loading, Qwik requires a tiny piece of Javascript to load at the beginning that knows how to download the rest of the application on an as-needed basis. We refer to that Javascript as Qwikloader.

Qwikloader is:

- small: about 1 kb minified.
- fast: it executes in less than 5ms even on mobile devices. (Initial cost, not per event cost.)

How is it delivered:

- Because of its size, we recommend delivering Qwikloader as inlined `<script>` tag. This way, the browser does not have to pay for the cost of creating another connection to the server.

What is the purpose of Qwikloader:

- register global browser events.
- if an event occurs, search the DOM for the corresponding event attribute pointing to the QRL to lazy-load.
- Lazy-load the event handler and execute it.

## How does it work

Below you can find a simple HTML with Qwikloader and a button with associated behavior.

```html
<html>
  <body q:base="/build/">
    <button onClickQrl="./myHandler.js#clickHandler">push me</button>
    <script>
      /* Qwikloader */
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

1. The browser downloads the HTML and executes the inlined Qwikloader script. The Qwikloader sets up global listeners for all browser events.
2. The user clicks on the `<button>`. The browser generates a `click` event that bubbles up the DOM until the Qwikloader's global listener intercepts it.
3. The Qwikloader retraces the event path and searches for `onClickQrl` attribute on the elements.
4. The Qwikloader uses the `onClickQrl` and `q:base` attributes along with the `document.baseURI` to build a full URL for fetching the lazy-loaded handler. Assuming the original page was served up from `http://localhost/` the fetch URL becomes `http://localhost/build/myHandler.js`.
5. Qwikloader retrieves the `clickHandler` symbol, exported from `http://localhost/build/myHandler.js` and invokes it.
