# Component anatomy

A component is a small, reusable piece of code that can be used to build a UI.

In Qwik, they are declared using the `component$` method:

```tsx
import { component$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';

// Qwik components can be asynchronous
export const MyCmp = component$(async (props: MyCmpProps) => {
  // Declare local state
  const state = useStore({
    count: 0,
  });

  // Returns JSX
  return (
    <Host>
      <span>Hello, {props.name} {state.count}</span>
      <div>Times: {state.count}</div>
      <button onClick$={() => {
        // This will update the local state and cause a re-render.
        // Reactivity is at qwik's core!
        state.count++;
      }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </Host>
  );
});
```

## Props

Props are used to pass data into the component. Props are declared as named arguments of the component.

In this example a component `Item` declares optional `name`, `quantity`, `description`, and `price`.

```tsx
interface ItemProps {
   name?: string,
   quantity?: number,
   description?: string,
   price?: number
}

export const Item = component$((props: ItemProps) => {
  return ...;
});
```

The resulting component can be used like so:

```tsx
const MyApp = component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      - With no props: <Item />
      - With some props: <Item description="Item description" />
      - With all props: <Item name="Hammer" quantity={3} description="Best organic hammer" price={10.0} />
    </>
  );
});
```

## Host element

The host element is an element in the DOM that represents component boundaries.

Qwik-components rely on host elements because it must be possible by looking on the HTML to determine where one component starts and another ends. Without knowing the boundaries, it would not be possible to render components independently without forcing parent/child components to render as well. This is a crucial feature of Qwik.

```tsx
const Child = component$(() => <span>child</span>);

const Parent = component$(() => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
));
```

Will result in:

```html
<div q:host>
  <section>
    <div q:host>
      <span>child</span>
    </div>
  </section>
</div>
```

Qwik host elements are marked with `q:host` attribute.

As you can see, `component$` will always create an extra element, by default is `div`, but that can be changed with `component$` options argument:

```tsx
const MyArticle = component$(() => (
  <span>My article</span>
), {
  tagName: 'article'
});
```

Will result in:

```html
<article q:host>
  <span>
    My article
  </span>
</article>
```

### `useHostElement()`

Since the host element is implicitly created by `component$`, it is not possible to access it directly. Instead, you can use `useHostElement()` to get the host element.

 Qwik uses host elements in various ways. For example when using `useHostElement()` function which retrieves it. It is also used to attach props to the components for serialization.




## Host Element Attributes & Styling

Assume you have a component defined as so:

```tsx
const Greeter = component$((props: {salutation?: string, name: string, }) => {
  ...
});
```

The component can be used like so:

```tsx
<Greeter name="World" />
```

or

```tsx
<Greeter salutation="Hello" name="World" />
```

In both above cases the rendered HTML would be:

```html
<div q:host></div>
```

Because the host element is an actual element, there may be a desire to place HTML classes, styles, or attributes on the host element.

What if you wanted to add a `name` attribute to the host element? The issue is that the `name` is already used by the component props. For this reason, we use `host:` prefix to refer to the host element's attributes.

```tsx
<Greeter
  host:name="abc"
  host:id="greeter"
  host:onClick$={() => {}}

  name="world"
/>
```

would render as:

```html
<div q:host name="abc" id="greeter" onClickQrl="..."></div>
```

Using a `host:` prefix allows the developer to control the component's host element attributes independently from the component's props.

One can use the same approach for `class` and `styles`.

```tsx
<Greeter host:class="greeter" host:style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }} name="world" />
```

would render:

```html
<div q:host class="greeter" style="background-color: red;"></div>
```

However, for convenience `class` and `styles` are special, and they will automatically map to `host:class` and `host:styles`
when placed on the host element.

```jsx
<Greeter
  class="greeter"
  style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}
  name="world"
/>
```

would also render to the same output.

```html
<div q:host class="greeter" style="background-color: red;"></div>
```

## `<Host/>`

It may also be desirable for a component to set `class`, `style` and `attributes` on the host element associated with the component itself. To do that, one can use `<Host>` tag.

```tsx
const Greeter = component$(() => {
  return (
    <Host class="padded" id="greeter">
      <span>Hello World</span>
    </Host>
  );
});
```

will result in:

```html
<div q:host class="padded" id="greeter">
  <span>Hello World</span>
</div>
```


## Lazy Loading

The host component also serves an important role when breaking parent-child relationships for bundling purposes.

```tsx
const Child = () => <span>child</span>;

const Parent = () => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
);
```

In the above example, referring to the `Parent` component implies a transitive reference to the `Child` component. When the bundler is creating a chunk, a reference to `Parent` necessitates bundling `Child` as well. (`Parent` internally refers to `Child`.) These transitive dependencies are a problem because it means that having a reference to the root component will transitively refer to the remainder of the applicationâ€”something which Qwik tries to avoid explicitly.


```tsx
const Child = component$(() => {
  return <span>child</span>;
});

const Parent = component$(() => {
  return (
    <section>
      <Child />
    </section>
  );
});
```

In the above example the Optimizer transforms the above to:

```tsx
const Child = componentQrl(qrl('./chunk-a', 'Child_onMount'));
const Parent = componentQrl(qrl('./chunk-b', 'Parent_onMount'));
const Parent_onMount = () => qrl('./chunk-c', 'Parent_onRender');
const Parent_onRender = () => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
);
```

NOTE: for simplicity, not all of the transformations are shown; all resulting symbols are kept in the same file for succinctness.

Notice that after the optimizer transforms the code, the `Parent` no longer directly references `Child`. This is important because it allows the bundler (and tree shakers) to freely move the symbols into different chunks without pulling the rest of the application with it.

So what happens when the `Parent` component renders and `Child` component has not yet been downloaded? First, the `Parent` component renders its JSX like so.

```html
<div q:host>
  <section>
    <div q:host></div>
  </section>
</div>
```

As you can see in the above example, the `<div q:host/>` acts as a marker where the `Child` component will be inserted once it is lazy-loaded.

## Mental Model

The optimizer splits Qwik components into the host element and the behavior of the component. The host element gets bundled with the parent components OnRender function, whereas the component's behavior is something that gets lazy-loaded on an as-needed basis.
