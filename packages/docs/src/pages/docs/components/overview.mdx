# Components

Components are basic building blocks of Qwik Applications. Qwik components are unique in that:

- Qwik components automatically get broken down into lazy-loaded chunks by the Optimizer. (See Optimizer discussion)
- Are [resumable](../concepts/resumable.mdx). (A component can get created on a server and continue its execution on the client.) (See resumable discussion)
- Can render independently of other components on the page. (See rendering discussion)

## `component$`

Qwik components are declared with `component$` API.

```tsx
const Counter = component$((props: { step?: number; initial?: number }) => {
  const store = useStore({ count: props.initial || 0 });

  return <button onClick$={() => (store.count += props.step || 1)}>{store.count}</button>;
});
```

NOTE:

- For an explanation of `$` see lazy-loading and Optimizer discussion.
- For a detailed discussion of props, see Component/props discussion.

## Using components

Qwik components can use other components.

```tsx
const Counter = component$((props: {step?:number, initial?: number}) => {
  ...
});

const MyApp = component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Single: <Counter /></div>
      <div>Dozens: <Counter step={12}/></div>
    </>
  );
});
```

The above example shows how the `MyApp` component can use the `Counter` component. The second example shows how one can use binding to pass values to the `Counter` component's props.

## Re-rendering on Reactivity

Qwik components are reactive on the component level. Component props, as well as stores, are proxies. These proxies track reads as well as writes.

- A proxy-read during OnRender function execution lets Qwik know that the OnRender function depends on a given property. A read creates a subscription on that property. In our example, OnRender reads`{store.count}`, which creates a subscription that tells Qwik that whenever the `store.count` changes, the component should be invalidated.
- A proxy-write notifies Qwik that all associated subscriptions should be invalidated.

When components get invalidated, they are added to the invalidation queue, which is flushed (rendered) on the next `requestAnimationFrame`. This acts as a form of coalescing for component rendering.

For a detailed discussion of reactivity, see related discussion.
