title: Serialization Graph

Stores are serializable on application pause. There are no restrictions on stores to be a directed acyclic graph. It is perfectly valid for stores to have cycles in them, and Qwik will correctly serialize it.

Stores can also store QRLs. QRLs will be discussed later.

There is no limit to how many stores can be created per component and where they are passed to. While it is a good practice to have top-down data flows, there is no such requirement from the Qwik framework.

For this example insert a few items into `parent.children` that will create a circular reference between parent and child stores.

This example also shows how you can attach closures to a store through the use of `$` and `QRL` and how to invoke them.
