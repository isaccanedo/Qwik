title: Synchronous Event Processing
layout: tutorial
---

At times it is necessary to process events synchronously. (This is not a common use case, so we are including it just in case.) This creates a problem for Qwik because all event processing in Qwik is asynchronous. This example shows how to eagerly load an event handler that can then process the event synchronously.

Fortunately, this pattern is rare, therefore it is not something we need to do often.

## Example 

Convert the `onClick$` from asynchronous event to synchronous event by using `useClientEffect` and normal event registration.
