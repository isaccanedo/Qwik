There are times when a listener needs to be added conditionally, the listener name is not known, or a use method needs to set up a listener. Qwik provides a programmatic way of setting up listeners.

Qwik provides these functions:
- `useOn()` Add event on specific event on current host element.
- `useOnDocument()` Add event on specific event on document.
- `useOnWindow()`: Add event on specific event on window.
- `useVisible$()`: Invoked when component becomes visible.
- `useResume$()`: Invoked on eagerly on application loading.

Set up a click listener on the component which will `alert('Hello world!')`.

## Understanding the `$`

`$` means lazy load this reference. When we are setting up a listener with `useOn` the second argument to `useOn` is a `QRL`. `QRL`s are lazy loadable references to your code. (More on QRLs later.) If `useOn` would take function directly (rather than QRL) it would have to be eagerly executed so that the JavaScript can allocate the listener closure. By converting it to QRL (using the `$` function) we can lazy load the closer only when `click` listener is triggered.
