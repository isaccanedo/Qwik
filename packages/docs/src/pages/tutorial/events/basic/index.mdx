So far we have created static applications that have no interactivity. An important reason why we use frameworks to build applications is for easy declaration of behavior. A key part of application behavior is to listen to user events. 

There are many different events browser support that Qwik can listen on. The general syntax is to place an attribute `on<Eventname>$` on an element to signal to the framework that we wish to listen to events here.

Add a `click` event on the `<button>` by adding the `onClick$` property and bind it to a function that will `alert('Hello World!')`.

## Understanding the Runtime

So far this may look like a normal framework behavior. However, Qwik does things very differently from current frameworks and it is worth understanding what is happening under the hood.

Every time you see `$` you should be thinking lazy-loading happens here.

If you open dev-tools you will see that no JavaScript is loaded until you click the button. This is achieved through several steps described below.

To better understand what is going on we have included simplified HTML of the application here. Click on the HTML tab to see actual HTML produced by the server.
```HTML
<html>
  <body>
    <button on:click="chunk-abc.js#App_onClick">
      Click Me
    </button>
    <script id="Qwikloader">....</script>
  </body>
</html>
```


1. The APIs contain `$` to ensure that your code contains them.
2. The Optimizer looks for `$` and extracts the function wrapped by `$` into a separate lazy-loadable chunk. (See the documentation to better understand how this is done.)
3. As part of the SSR the server executes the JSX and notices that there is a click listener. The click listener gets serialized into the `<button>` element as `on:click` attribute. (The unique behavior is that the Qwik knows how to subscribe to events as part of the SSR.)
4. Qwikloader scripts get inlined into HTML. The Qwikloader script sets up a global listener for all events in the browser. (Qwikloader is about 1kb and executes in about 1ms.)
5. When a user clicks on the button the Qwikloader intercepts the event and looks for an element with `on:click` attribute.
6. The `on:click` attribute contains:
   - URL that contains the code to be downloaded (Qwik also set up prefetching of code so there is no delay between click and execution.)
   - A symbol that is exported by the downloaded chunk that contains the function to execute.
7. Once the code is downloaded the function is executed. 

The above behavior is what gives Qwik applications their instant-on property (resumability) without eagerly downloading and executing code and performing hydration which is expensive.

NOTE: To ensure that there is no delay between user action and response, Qwik supports prefetching of code.
