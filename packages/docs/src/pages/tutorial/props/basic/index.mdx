Web applications are built up from components in the same way that general applications are built up from functions. Composing functions would not be very useful if functions would not allow us to pass parameters to them. In the same way that functions have parameters components have props. We use props to pass data from parent to child components.

Modify the code so that the parent `<App>` can pass `salutation="Hello"` and  `name="World"` to the `<Greeter>`. Add properties to the `GreeterProps` interface and then add the necessary bindings.
