## --------------------------------------------------
THIS API IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET. SHOWING HERE JUST TO GET THE GENERAL DIRECTION WE ARE TAKING.
## --------------------------------------------------

Use `useUnMount$()` to run cleanup code when the component is removed. 

NOTE: `useCleanup$()` API is similar, but `useCleanup$()` runs not only when the component is removed but also when the application is paused. Use `useCleanup$()` for general cleanup code for resources that can't be serialized. In contrast, `useUnMount$()` is a general notification that the component is going away.
