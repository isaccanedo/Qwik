Use `useHostElement()` to retrieve a reference to the current component's host element. 

In this example, we have added all of the host element APIs in a single location.
- `tagName`: is used to set a host element's tag name to something other than `<div>`.
- `<Host>`: is used to data bind the component's host element. 
- `useHostElement()`: is used to retrieve a reference to the host element instance.


DOM Elements references are serializable within the context of Qwik.
